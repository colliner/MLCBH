**MLCBH**: Effective Molecular Descriptors for Chemical Accuracy at DFT Cost: Fragmentation, Error-cancellation, and Machine Learning
=======
*Under review* [https://doi.org]

MLCBH is a set of generalized molecular descriptors for machine learning based on solely on the connectivity of the molecule. These representations are derived from the fragmentation scheme of the Connectivity Based Hierarchy (CBH) [https://doi.org/10.1021/ct200279q] of generalized isodemic reactions. 

This repository provides scripts to generate the representation and define ML model along with the **1k-G4-C9** dataset used in the MLCBH paper, which is comprised of G4 calculated âˆ†Hf(298K) of 1051 experimentally stable organic molecules with 9 or fewer carbon atoms.

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/colliner/MLCBH`

## Requirements

`smiles2cbh/smiles2cbh.py` is a python script to generate the MLCBH input representations and requires a number of dependencies:

- `python3`
- `numpy`
- `fragreact` a Python package for the fragmentation and generation of the generalized isodesmic reactions [https://github.com/jensengroup/fragreact]

`network/MLPRegressor.py` is a python script defining the MLCBH-2 model used in this study and requires:

- `python3`
- `scikit-learn` a free machine learning library for the Python [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html]
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
